  ingredients: [
    '1 package phyllo dough (16 oz)',
    '2 cups chopped walnuts or pistachios',
    '1 cup unsalted butter, melted',
    '1 cup granulated sugar',
    '1 cup water',
    '½ cup honey',
    '1 tsp vanilla extract',
    '1 tsp ground cinnamon',
    '½ tsp ground cloves'
  ],
  humanSteps: [
    'Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with melted butter to prevent the baklava from sticking.',
    'In a mixing bowl, combine the chopped nuts, cinnamon, and cloves. This mixture will create the layers of nutty goodness in your baklava.',
    'Unroll the phyllo dough and cut it to fit your baking dish, covering the unused sheets with a damp towel to prevent them from drying out.',
    'Place one sheet of phyllo dough in the baking dish and brush it generously with melted butter. Repeat this process for about 10 sheets, ensuring each layer is well-buttered.',
    'Sprinkle a thin layer of the nut mixture over the phyllo. Cover with another 5 sheets of phyllo, buttering each layer. Continue this layering process—phyllo, butter, nuts—until all the nut mixture is used, finishing with 10 sheets of phyllo dough on top.',
    'Using a sharp knife, cut the baklava into diamond or square shapes, making sure to cut all the way through to the bottom of the dish.',
    'Bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until the baklava is golden and crisp.',
    'While the baklava is baking, prepare the syrup by combining the sugar, water, and honey in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in the vanilla extract and let it cool slightly.',
    'Once the baklava is baked, immediately pour the warm syrup evenly over the hot baklava, ensuring it seeps into all the layers. Let it cool completely before serving, ideally overnight to allow the flavors to meld.'

  scienceFact: 'Baklava’s flaky texture comes from the science of layering and baking phyllo dough. Each thin sheet of phyllo is separated by butter, creating air pockets that expand during baking, resulting in the crisp, delicate texture. The syrup, added after baking, absorbs into the layers, balancing the crispness with sweetness. The use of nuts adds not just flavor but texture and a touch of natural oils, which interact with the butter and syrup to create a melt-in-your-mouth experience.'

  note: 'Baklava has been a family tradition for as long as I can remember. Growing up in Greece, my grandmother would gather us in her cozy kitchen and teach us how to layer the phyllo dough just right. She always said the secret ingredient was patience. I learned to perfect the recipe during my university years, often making it for friends during cultural nights. Every time I bake baklava, I’m reminded of the warm kitchen, laughter, and the love that went into every layer.'
